# PWC Power BI Virtual internship Task 3 - HR Diversity and Inclusion 

## Problem Statement :

The purpose of this analysis is to:

- Define proper KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover
- Create a visualisation for the HR manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance indicators(KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
- The following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

- '#' of men
- '#' of women
- '#' of leavers
- % employees promoted (FY21)
- % of women promoted
- % of hires men
- % turnover
- Average performance rating: men
- Average performance rating: women

## Data Cleaning

- Each of the columns in the table were validated to have the correct data type too.

## Calculated Measures created using DAX:

Measures used in  all visualization are:

- # Avg Men Rating = `CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 Performance Rating]),FILTER('Pharma Group AG', 'Pharma Group AG'[Gender] = "Male"))`

- # female = `CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]), FILTER('Pharma Group AG', 'Pharma Group AG'[Gender] = "Female"))`

- # male = `CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]), FILTER('Pharma Group AG', 'Pharma Group AG'[Gender] = "Male"))`

- # Promoted FY20 = `CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),'Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY20?]="Y")+CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY21?]),'Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY21?]="Yes")`

- #Avg Female Rating = `CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 Performance Rating]),FILTER('Pharma Group AG', 'Pharma Group AG'[Gender] = "Female"))`

- #Employee Turnover = `DIVIDE('Pharma Group AG'[#Leaver],COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),0)`

- #Leaver = `CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]), 'Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes")`

- % female = `DIVIDE('Pharma Group AG'[# female], 'Pharma Group AG'[# female] + 'Pharma Group AG'[# male])`

- % male = `DIVIDE('Pharma Group AG'[# male], 'Pharma Group AG'[# female] + 'Pharma Group AG'[# male])`


## Data Visualization (Dashboard):

## Insights:

As per the visualizations, it has been deduced that :

- In total, 205 females and 295 males are there in the company.
- 41% of hires were female
- 59% of hires were male
- 2.41 is the average rating of men
- 2.42 is the average rating of women
- In age group 30â€“39, the total number of employees within this range totals 115 while the females total 59.
- Also, it seems that more male employees in are promoted to higher-level job profiles than females.
- The higher turnover percentage is among female employees.

## Recommendation:

Some recommendations based on the analysis are:

- There is a need to look into the rate of employment of staffs from different nationality, people of different nationality should be encouraged to take up roles in the company.

- From the analysis above the rate of Diversity and Inclusion is low considering how that there's gender imbalance in how staffs are hired and promoted.
